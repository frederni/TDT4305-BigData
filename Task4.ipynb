Namely, people who have questions in areas such as computer science or data science and knowledgeable people who can answer those questions reliably. Let's call the first category of people' knowledge seekers' and the second one 'expert users' or 'experts' for short.\n\nHere we want to answer a question related to the diversity of topics that experts are interested in using our data. We want to know if expert users only answer questions in a specific set of topics or their interests include a wide variety of topics.\n\nTo answer the above question, we will compute the correlation between a user's expertise level and the diversity of topics of questions they have answered. The first step is to define two variables (or measures); first for 'user expertise level' and then for 'user interest diversity'. Then we will use the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear correlation between the two variables. We define the variables as:\n\n   - VariableA (the measure of user expertise level). We will use the 'Reputation' column from 'users' table, which according to Stack Exchange's documentation \"is a rough measurement of how much the community trusts you; it is earned by convincing your peers that you know what you're talking about\" as an indicator of a user's expertise level on the platform. \n\n   - VariableB (The measure of user interest diversity). We measure the diversity of a user's interests by computing the total number of distinct tags associated with the questions each user has answered divided by the total number of unique tags which is 638.\n\nCompute the Pearson correlation coefficient between VariableA and VariableB, and based on the result you've got, answer the following question: \n\n     Do expert users have specif interests or do they have general interests?\n\nPlease explain your reasoning on how you reached your answer.\n\nYou should use Apache Spark API for your implementation.

For the case of reputation, we already have the final expression stored in our data (User's reputation). For the case of interest diversity, we need to use transformations on the existing table information before we can compute the correlation. The interest diversity is measured for each user, by counting the *unique* tags for each question where the user has a reply, and diving by the unique number of all tags. We may formally define the diversity measure as follows:\n\nLet \\\\(\\mathcal T\\\\) be the set of all tags and \\\\(\\mathcal T_i\\\\) be the set of tags in which user \\\\(i\\\\) has replied. Then, the diversity measure becomes\n$$\n\\text{Diversity}_i := \\frac{\\sum_{u\\in \\mathcal T_i} (u)}{\\sum_{v \\in \\mathcal T}(v)}\n$$\n\nThe implementation can be summarized as follows:\n```\n1) Find reply-posts with the original question's corresponding tags and extract tags and reply user ID\n2) Map result to a DF with ID and seperated tags\n3) Group result by ID and flatten all tag lists\n4) Convert the flattened tag list to a set, excluding duplicate tags, and divide the set's length by total number of tags\n5) Match user reputation to the newly obtained diversity measure (based on user ID) and compute the correlation coefficient\n```"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"a5d203e1-ee4f-4ffe-902b-621c027cff89"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## YOUR IMPLEMENTATION ##\n## ___________________ ##\n## CREATE DIVERSITY DF ##\n\ndef get_tags_list(df: DataFrame) -> Tuple[int, list]:\n  # Splits the tag string into a list, also returns the owner user ID\n  out_list = [] if df[\"Tags\"] is None else df[\"Tags\"][1:-1].split(\"><\")\n  return (df[\"OwnerUserId\"], out_list)\n\ndef run_query2(query: \"a SQL query string\", df1: \"DataFrame A\", df2: \"DataFrame B\"):\n  # SQL Query function for one or two DataFrames \n  df1.createOrReplaceTempView(\"df1\")\n  if df2 is not None:\n    df2.createOrReplaceTempView(\"df2\")\n  out_df = spark.sql(query)\n  return out_df\n\ndef flatten(df: DataFrame) -> Tuple[int, list]:\n  \"\"\"Flattens lists of\n  When we group the data by user ID, we may get an RDD on the form (123, [['A', 'B'], ['C', 'A', 'D'], ...])\n  This mapping function uses `itertools.chain` to flatten all arrays into ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'D'], so that\n  We can easier determine duplicates and sizes.\n  \"\"\"\n  to_flatten = df[1:]\n  flattened = []\n  for el in to_flatten:\n    flattened.append(list(itertools.chain(*el)))\n  return (df[0], list(itertools.chain(*flattened)))\n\nq_df = posts_df[posts_df[\"PostTypeId\"] == 1] # Questions\na_df = posts_df[posts_df[\"PostTypeId\"] == 2] # Answers\n\n# Join question-tags to answer post-owner-id since tags are only written in questions-posts.\nOUT_0 = run_query2(\"SELECT df2.Tags, df1.OwnerUserId FROM df1 INNER JOIN df2 ON df1.ParentId = df2.Id\", a_df, q_df)\nnew_rdd = OUT_0.rdd.map(get_tags_list)\ndiversity_df = new_rdd.groupByKey().mapValues(list).map(flatten).map(lambda df: (df[0], 1/638 * len(set(df[1])))).toDF([\"ID\", \"Diversity\"])"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"717b4686-f208-468f-a43b-4f171baeea2e"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## YOUR IMPLEMENTATION ##\n## Get Correlation Coefficient ##\n\ncorr_df = run_query2(\"SELECT df1.Diversity, df2.Reputation FROM df1 INNER JOIN df2 ON df1.ID = df2.Id ORDER BY df2.Reputation DESC\", diversity_df, users_df)\ncorr_df.stat.corr(\"Diversity\", \"Reputation\")"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"29b84400-d5c3-4750-9dec-05a8a2c96d9b"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"Out[4]: 0.7217677648622942","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"ansi","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Out[4]: 0.7217677648622942"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We see that we get a correlation of about 0.722.

Thus, a value of about 0.722 indicates some degree of positive correlation, which suggests that the experts may have more general interests. This is of course not guaranteed, as one can imagine that knowledge seekers asking questions within some topics (e.g. Machine Learning), attach a lot of tags compared to other topics. If this is the case, experts could have a very specialized interest Machine Learning, but based on the correlation have a very diverse tag activity. This downside comes down to how the diversity measure is calculated, since there is naturally correlation between tags within a certain topic as well. In addition, concluding based on the correlation alone may not always be statistically significant, so preforming hypotheses tests would be a better way to determine the question at hand. This is however outside the scope of this course.\n\nIn conclusion, the correlation alone seem to indicate that users with higher reputation has a (relatively weak) tendency to reply to questions across multiple tags/topics, but this claim is not rigorously supported."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"dc1dcac9-a8cf-4ce0-875f-8314363a0ad1"}}}],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+notebook":{"notebookName":"Task4","dashboards":[],"notebookMetadata":{"pythonIndentUnit":2},"language":"python","widgets":{},"notebookOrigID":1967954973228927}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
